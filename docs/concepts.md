# Ocean4DVarNet

---
## **Core Concept**

4DVarNet blends:
- **4D-Variational data assimilation (4D-Var)**: A method used to optimally combine a numerical model with observations over a time window.
- **Deep learning**: Neural networks learn to model complex dynamics and correct for model errors.
  
It learns to **reconstruct missing data** over both space and time (the "4D" stands for 3D space + time).

---
## **How It Works**

- It uses a neural network **within a variational optimization loop**.
- Given **partial observations** (like satellite data), it:
    1. Predicts the full state over time.
    2. Minimizes a **loss function** that balances between:
        - Staying close to the observations.
        - Being consistent with a learned dynamical prior (the network).
    3. Refines its predictions iteratively (like traditional 4D-Var).

## Applications

- **Oceanographic reconstructions** (e.g. Sea Surface Height fields).
- **Climate modeling**.
- **Atmospheric reanalysis**.
- Any setting where data is sparse, noisy, and spatiotemporal.
