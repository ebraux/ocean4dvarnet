# Pull Request Workflow

When submitting Pull Requests (PRs), please follow these guidelines:

1. Open a draft Pull Request early in your development process. This helps:
    - Make your work visible to other contributors.
    - Get early feedback on your approach.
    - Avoid duplicate efforts.
    - Track progress on complex changes.
2. Fill the PR template completely, including:
    - Clear description of the changes.
    - Link to related issues using GitHub keywords (e.g., “Fixes #123”).
    - List of notable changes.
    - Any breaking changes or deprecations.
    - Testing instructions if applicable.
3. Ensure the PR title follows the PR Title Guidelines, as this will become the squash commit message when merged to main.
4. Keep your PR focused and of reasonable size:
    - One PR should address one concern.
    - Split large changes into smaller, logical PRs.
    - Update documentation along with code changes.
5. Before marking as ready for review:
    - Ensure all tests pass locally.
    - Address any automated check failures.
    - Review your own changes.
    - Update based on any feedback received while in draft.
6. When ready for review:
    - Mark the PR as “Ready for Review”
    - Request reviews from appropriate team members.
    - Be responsive to review comments.
    - Update the PR description if significant changes are made.
7. After approval:
    - PRs are merged using squash merge to maintain a clean history.
    - The squash commit message will use the PR title.
