## Making predictions with a pre-trained model

If you would like to make predictions with a model that has already been trained, e.g. AIFS Single 1. See the Ocean4DVarNet-inference getting started guide.


---
## Training a new model through configuration

If you would like to train a new model on a sample dataset, making use of building blocks which already exist in the Ocean4DVarNet codebase. See the Ocean4DVarNet-training getting started guide.

---
## Contributing use-cases

We would love to make Ocean4DVarNet even easier for everyone to use.

If there are any use-cases you would like to see covered in the future, please consider contacting the developers or creating a pull request to the Ocean4DVarNet repository.
